# Classification-from-EEG-Data
We used electroencephalography (EEG) data that was collected from 17 human participants during a perceptual decision-making task for this project. In each trial of this experiment, the participants were, first, shown a cue regarding the type of the upcoming stimulus where the upcoming stimulus was the point-light display of a human movement: walking or kicking. The target stimulus was shown on one side of the screen while scrambled motion was shown on the other side. The participants were asked to report on which side of the screen the meaningful biological human movement occurred. Our purpose is to employ algorithms that can decode the type of stimulus (walking/kicking). Considering the previous literature and the problem at hand, we decided to implement 3 algorithms that could achieve the desired results: support vector machines (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) along with principal component analysis (PCA) for feature reduction.
